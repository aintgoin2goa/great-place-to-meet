    "<p>When the new European Central Bank headquarters opens towards the end of this year, employees and visitors are destined to become patrons of Oosten. This café/bar/restaurant, sits insouciantly beside the ECB’s gleaming towers and adjacent to the northern bank of the river Main. </p>",
    "<p>A melange of steel, glass, exposed concrete and wood, the three-level venue comes alive in the summer when bankers and creative-types dine al fresco or sip cocktails on the terrace at sundown. A ship-loading crane is integrated into the building structure and a rail carriage is parked next door, reflecting the dynamism and history of the nearby harbour. </p>",
    "<p>Oosten’s tree-lined beer garden tends to fill up. If the hubbub and piped funky jazz music get too much, you can save more discreet business discussions for a stroll along the river. </p>",
    "<p>The riverside location, however, is both a selling point and a drawback. There is no car park on site; instead patrons are invited to leave vehicles on a nearby street or at a car park five minutes away by foot. Take a cab or tram, or better still: join the cyclists on the river path.</p>",
    "<p>Brunch is available until 4pm and ticks a cornucopia of culinary boxes: Turkish, British, Swedish, Italian, Dutch, Greek and French breakfast options are offered. Want to skip breakfast? Try the Yellowfin tuna steak with vegetables, wasabi-coconut risotto and ginger (€25,50). But be warned: credit cards are not accepted so take cash.</p>"
