    "<p>The former docklands of Sweden’s industrial second city are now home to a cluster of high-tech companies and research institutes housed in vigorous glass and steel. So to lunch at the <a title=\"Cuckoo's Nest\" href=\"http://www.cuckoosnest.se/en#/start\">Cuckoo’s Nest </a>is to rub shoulders with the entrepreneurs and academics that the bar and restaurant sets out to welcome. </p>",
    "<p>Even in winter this spot is popular, so it is wise to book in advance. In summer you can sit out on the terrace overlooking the water. Swedes eat early — lunch is served from 11.30am to 2pm. You can also have breakfast there if the hotel above — the restaurant is located on the ground floor of a Radisson Blu — is not full.</p>",
    "<p>To get here, clear your head and lungs with a quick hop on the ferry across the Göta river to Lindholmen — there is a frequent shuttle from Rosenlund pier, or twice an hour from the opera house. Gothenburg is a small city, so the riverside is unlikely to be more than a short walk or tram ride from your hotel.</p>",
    "<p>The venue is located two minutes from the Lindholmen pier. Its comfortable, modern interior is designed to appeal to the technically minded, with mathematical equations inscribed on the bar. </p>",
    "<p>The menu is limited, but enticing, and moderately priced. The bar has a selection of good wines and some excellent local beers, while its dry martinis and G &amp; Ts are a house speciality.</p>"
